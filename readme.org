this file parses a list of files and produces output readable by
wordle (http://www.wordle.net/).  it has rudimentary support for
removing latex commands and for combining similar words
(e.g. "simulation" and "simulations").  it also colorizes words using
the [[http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized][solarized]] palette.

this is pretty rough code; it's not meant to be a finished package.
rather, you should hack it to meet your needs

example output:
